            <h2>About -</h2>
            <p>Bastar is a district in the state of Chhattisgarh in Central India. Jagdalpur is the district headquarters. Bastar is bounded on the northwest by Narayanpur District, on the north by Kondagaon District, on the east by Nabarangpur and Koraput Districts of Odisha State, on the south and southwest by Dantewada and Sukma. The district possesses a unique blend of tribal and Odia culture.

                Bastar and Dantewada districts were formerly part of the princely state of Bastar. Bastar was founded in the early 14th century, by Annama Deva, the brother of Kakatiya King Pratapa Rudra Deva of Warangal in Telangana. After India achieved independence in 1947, the princely states of Bastar and Kanker acceded to the Government of India, and were merged to form Bastar district of Madhya Pradesh. The district, which had an area of 39,114 kmÂ², was one of the largest in India when formed.<br>
                
                In 1999, the district was divided into the present-day districts of Bastar, Dantewada, and Kanker. In 2000, Bastar was one of the 16 Madhya Pradesh districts that formed a part of the new state of Chhattisgarh. In 2012, it was divided again to form Kondgaon district. These four districts are part of Bastar Division.<br>
                
                Bastar is known for its traditional Dussehra festival. The Chitrakoot and Teerathgarh waterfalls are situated close to Jagdalpur.<br>
                
                The district is a part of the Red Corridor.Gondi and Halbi are the two main languages, while Chhattisgarhi and Hindi are also spoken. It has been a tourist attraction for decades for its rich diversity of flora and fauna.</p>

            <h2>Administration -</h2>
            <p>Administratively, the district is divided into four tehsils, Jagdalpur, and Bastar. The district has one municipality, Jagdalpur. Jagdalpur, the administrative headquarters, is a city with a population of about 150,000. Transport railway stations- 11 ; RTc deposits - 03; Airports- Jagdalpur.</p>

            <h2>Demographics -</h2>
            <p>According to the 2011 census, Bastar District had a population of 1,413,199 before its split into Kondagaon and Bastar, after the split having a population of 834,873. This gives it a ranking of 348th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 140 inhabitants per square kilometre (360/sq mi) . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.83%. Bastar has a sex ratio of 1024 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 54.94%.

                After the splitting of Kondagaon district, the district's population is 834873. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 1.67% and 63.05% of the population respectively.
                
                In 1981, Bastar had a population of 1,842,854 with 1,249,197 of the residents being members of scheduled tribes. This represented about 68% of the population.However, these figures are for the pre-1999 Bastar District, which had the same boundaries as the modern Bastar Division. In 2011, still approximately two thirds of those in the division were tribals.</p>


            <h2>Economy -</h2>
            <p>Rice is grown predominantly during kharif season as the rain fed crop across a 2.38.9 million hectare area. However, the productivity of this crop is low, with only 08.53 qt/ha. The irrigated area (1.67%) and fertilizer use (4.6 kg/ha.) in the Bastar district is less than in other places of Chhattisgarh, and is insufficient to supply nutrients to the crop.<br>

                The pattern of livelihood in Bastar continues to be dictated by tradition. Even today, agricultural practices are traditional. Use of wooden ploughs is common while the number of iron ploughs is negligible. The same is true of bullock carts. The number of tractors is negligible while the bullock carts are all pervasive.<br>
                
                The usage of traditional agricultural implements has lowered the production of agriculture. The kharif crops grown here are paddy, urad, arhar, jowar and maize. The rabi crops include til, alsi, moong, mustard and gram. Forest-related work, including collection and sale of forest produce, supplements the meagre agricultural income of the population.</p>

            <h2>Forest gatherers and labourers -</h2>
            <p>People living close to the forests but who have no land or very little land become forest gatherers and/or labourers. They are heavily dependent on forest produce, which they gather and sell or directly consume. At times, this leads to conflicts with the forest administration, due to differences between the customary and official use patterns of the forest. Occasional labour on fields or in the forest supplements their income. Migrant labour is also prevalent among the tribal population of Bastar, especially among the Bison Horn Maria.</p>

            <h2>Agriculturists and forest gatherers -
            </h2>
            <p>those with some land, and living in the vicinity of forests, typically become agriculturists and forest gatherers. A major part of the household consumption and income is based on forest gathering, with agricultural activities providing supplementary income.</p>
